# When the Music Stops: Tip-of-the-Tongue Retrieval for Music


This repository contains data collected in the paper 'When the Music Stops: Tip-of-the-Tongue Retrieval for Music'. To appear at SIGIR2023! 

### Abstract

We present a study of Tip-of-the-tongue ( ToT) retrieval for music, where a searcher is trying to find an existing music entity, but is unable to succeed as they cannot accurately recall important identifying information. ToT information needs are characterized by complexity, verbosity, uncertainty, and possible false memories. We make four contributions. (1) We collect a dataset—$ToT_{Music}$ —of 2,278 information needs and ground truth answers. (2) We introduce a schema for these information needs and show that they often involve multiple modalities encompassing several Music IR sub-tasks such as lyric search, audio-based search, audio fingerprinting, and text search. (3) We underscore the difficulty of this task by benchmarking a standard text retrieval approach on this dataset. (4) We investigate the efficacy of query reformulations generated by a large language model ( LLM), and show that they are not as effective as simply employing the entire information need as a query – leaving several open questions for future research.

### Description

Data can be downloaded using [this link](data.jsonl.zip), which is a zipped JSONL file with one information need per line. You can view an example docuument [here](#example-document). Each field and accompanying description is outlined in the table below:
